# Predicting screen time of characters from a video using OpenCV an Keras
This repository shares how we can predict screen time of characters from a video.
I am using Tom and Jerry video for this prediction and output is the screen time of Tom amd Jerry in seconds
#### I have considered following instances:
```
  0: none are present
  1: only Jerry is present
  2: only Tom is present
  3: both are present
```
#### Use mapping.csv referred from Tom and jerry.mp4 as training dataset and testing.csv referred from Tom and Jerry 3.mp4 as testing dataset
#### Potential use cases:
```
1. Calculating number of vehicles on the road using webcam
2. Handwriting recognition
3. Scanning of scoresheets
4. Creating simple games like Rock-Paper-Scissor
5. Colour Detection
... and many more
